# User Detection

For user detection, the first approach is to determine if users are bots or not on the given platform, as this is one of the key things to note when trying to create a digitally respected identity for anybody.

Our Solution for this is the usage of Machine Learning.

The project will implement a novel method to detect bots (bot management).

Another challenge for us would be in creating a base implementation for this user detector, after it has been been exposed to the social media section seeing each social media incorporate different design methos as weell as exposed api for consumption.

The first social media we'd work with is X.com (formally known as twitter) as currently there's a lot of reference material (albeit deprecated or old) we can start development using these materials.

- Botometer by Indiana University
- twitonomy
- botsentinel

None of these cited examples are running ever since twitter deactivated the free V1.1 endpoints.
